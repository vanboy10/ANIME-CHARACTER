# Creating Anime Characters using DCGANs and Keras💢

This project aims to generate anime characters using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) implemented with Keras.😉


## Overview🌈

Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) are a class of deep learning models used for generating new data samples. In this project, we utilize DCGANs to generate anime characters. DCGANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator learns to generate new images, while the discriminator learns to differentiate between real and generated images.

## Requirements👌
- Python 3.x🤩
- TensorFlow🤠
